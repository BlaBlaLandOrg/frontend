## üßê Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>

The world is experiencing a growing sense of loneliness due to a concerning lack of meaningful interpersonal connections and the increasing difficulty in finding individuals with whom to engage in genuine conversations. This trend is leading to a myriad of negative consequences, including deteriorating mental health, decreased empathy, and a diminishing sense of community and belonging, prompting an urgent need to address the root causes of this societal isolation and foster healthier, more connected human interactions.

## üí° Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>

A service allowing unlimited conversations with virtual characters through text-to-speech and speech-to-text helps combat loneliness. Users benefit from judgment-free talks, round-the-clock availability, personalized connections, and mental health support. It fosters empathy, enhances social skills, and creates a sense of community, alleviating the growing problem of isolation.

## üöÄ Future Scope <a name = "future_scope"></a>

The Project could be continued beyond the scope of this Hackathon in a market validation process by testing how real world users would interact with an application like this.
